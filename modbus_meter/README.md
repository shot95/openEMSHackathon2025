# Custom Energy meter
This directory contains the code to run a custom energymeter modbus server. 
This will be used in our beginner tutorial as an implementation practice.

- meter_server.py: The modbus server that is running on a raspberry pi
- meter_connection_test.py: A simple script to test the connection to the pi and reads out relevant values once.
- modbus_table.txt: The modbus table generated by the server
- openemsMeter: A sample openEMS implementation for this meter
